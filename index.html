              A proper article indicates that its noun is proper, and refers to
              a unique entity. It may be the name of a person, the name of a
              place, the name of a planet, etc. The Māori language has the
              proper article a, which is used for personal nouns; so, "a Pita"
              means "Peter". In Māori, when the personal nouns have the definite
              or indefinite article as an important part of it, both articles
              are present; for example, the phrase "a Te Rauparaha", which
              contains both the proper article a and the definite article Te
              refers to the person name Te Rauparaha.

              Bollywood Movie Awards in 1999.[1] Michael Jackson won a
              Humanitarian Award in 1999, Richard Gere a Man of Conscience
              award.

              In the technical sense a journal has continuous pagination
              throughout a volume. Thus Business Week, which starts each issue
              anew with page one, is a magazine, but the Journal of Business
              Communication, which continues the same sequence of pagination
              throughout the coterminous year, is a journal. Some professional
              or trade publications are also peer-reviewed, for example the
              Journal of Accountancy.
